# Djikstra Algorithm Path Finder
This Python script implements a path-finding algorithm using the Djikstra Algorithm 
within a graphical interface created with Pygame. The program allows the user to 
define start and end points, add obstacles, and find the shortest path 
between the start and end points.

# Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Pygame library
* Tkinter library

# Installation

* Install Pygame using pip:
` pip install pygame`
# Usage
* Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
` python filename.py `
* The graphical interface window will open with an empty grid.
* Define the start point by clicking on a grid cell.
* Define the end point by clicking on another grid cell.
* Add obstacles by clicking and dragging the mouse.
* Press any key to start the Djikstra Algorithm.
* The algorithm will find the shortest path and visualize the process on the grid.
# Controls
* Left Mouse Click: Set start point, end point, or add obstacles.
* Key Press: Start the Djikstra Algorithm.

# Notes
* Ensure that the Pygame library and Tkinter library are installed before running the script.
* Click on the grid cells to interact with the application.
